            <p>You're the moon that glows in the sky<br>
            Lighting up the world when it's blue<br>
            Stars they dance though late in the night<br>
            Don't you know they dance just for you<br>
            There you are above darkened clouds<br>
            Smiling at the world from afar<br>
            With the stars you wander around<br>
            May they follow you wherever you are<br><br>

            Here I am just another boy<br>
            Singing songs that others have sung<br>
            Trying to find the words to employ<br>
            To adore the goddess of love<br>
            Oh you got me in a daze yeah<br>
            No it's not another phase<br>
            You gave me one look and now I can't get my mind off of you<br>
            And it's all because<br><br>

            I see the galaxies when I look in your eyes and I<br>
            Can't speak no I<br>
            Can't speak at all<br>
            I swear to Zeus you're Aphrodite in disguise<br>
            Don't think that you can hide it from me<br>
            Oh no I never thought I'd get this close to someone so divine<br>
            Oh I can't breathe no I can't breathe at all<br>
            Aphrodite could you could you please be mine oh<br>
            Could you please be mine oh mine<br><br>

            Here you are I've waited so long<br>
            Hoping you would sit down to stay<br>
            'Cause with these stars I've been dancing along<br>
            Like a fool so you'd look my way<br>
            You're the moon that glows in the sky<br>
            Lighting up the world when it's blue<br>
            And here I sing though late in the night<br>
            Hope you know I sing just for you</p>
