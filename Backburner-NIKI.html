            <p>I can't lie, it feels nice that you're calling<br>
            You sound sad and alone, and you're stalling<br>
            And for once, I don't care about what you want<br>
            As long as we keep talking (As long as we're talking)<br>
            I mean, you gotta admit the history's kind of unmatched<br>
            Asian Calvinism, we made it out of that<br>
            Well, whether we're free of will or predestined<br>
            Clearly, I've not learned my lesson even now<br>
            Hope He doesn't strike me down (Strike me down)<br><br>

            The Goo Goo Dolls are dead to me<br>
            The way you should be, too<br>
            But you bring them up<br>
            Along with how much I fucking miss you<br><br>

            Maybe I'm just not better than this, I haven't tried<br>
            Maybe life's less romantic when I don't wanna die<br>
            You'd think I'd be a fast learner<br>
            But guess I won't ever mind crisping up on your backburner<br><br>

            Backburner<br>
            Your backburner<br>
            Your backburner<br>
            Your backburner<br>
            You might also like<br><br>

            It's pathetic, but at least you are, too<br>
            I don't know what to do<br>
            I don't like anyone except sometimes you<br>
            And now you're sounding like a hurt puppy<br>
            You look ugly when you cry<br>
            But I'm the one you think to call<br>
            How do you feel lucky and appalled at the same time?<br>
            After everything you put me through<br>
            I somehow still believe in you, oh-oh<br><br>

            But I know in a week or so<br>
            You'll fade away again<br>
            And I wish that I cared<br>
            Hey, are you still there?<br>
            Good<br><br>

            Maybe I'm just not better than this, I haven't tried<br>
            'Cause maybe you'll finally choose me after you've had more time<br>
            I thought I was a fast learner<br>
            But guess I won't ever mind, guess I won't ever mind<br>
            Maybe I blame my mother bleeding into my stride<br>
            Maybe it was my father and his wandering eyes<br>
            (It's their fault that) I'll always be in your corner<br>
            'Cause I don't feel alive 'til I'm burnin' on your backburner, oh-oh (Backburner, your backburner)<br><br>

            Oh, and I know that it's sad that I settle for the backburner, oh-oh<br>
            (Your backburner, your backburner)<br>
            (Your backburner, your backburner)<br>
            Oh, guess I won't ever mind crisping up on your backburner, oh-oh<br>
            (Your backburner, your backburner)<br>
            (Backburner, your backburner)<br>
            Oh, as long as you still think of me, oh, oh-oh<br>
            (Backburner, backburner)</p>
