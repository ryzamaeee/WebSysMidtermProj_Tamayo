            <p> I don't go out, but I'll do it for you<br>
            You never liked it when I drink too much<br>
            I hate to dance, but I'll dance with you<br>
            'Cause I'd do anything to feel your touch<br><br>

            Don't like anybody, tell me why it's different with you<br>
            Don't believe in love, but no one makes me feel like you do<br>
            I don't say it much, 'cause I just always thought that you knew, I<br><br>

            It's what you do to me<br>
            I'm wrapped around your finger and I can't stop<br>
            You know I got a soft spot for you<br>
            You know I got a soft spot for you<br>
            Baby, can't you see?<br>
            I need you, 'cause you're everything that I'm not<br>
            You know I got a soft spot for you<br>
            You know I got a soft spot for you<br><br>

            Too late<br>
            Don't wanna fall, baby, I just<br>
            Don't need somebody else to throw me aside<br>
            But I'm up all night<br>
            Thinkin' 'bout how it can be you to change my heart, but I<br><br>

            Don't like anybody, tell me why it's different with you<br>
            Don't believe in love, but no one makes me feel like you do<br>
            I don't say it much, 'cause I just always thought that you knew, I<br><br>

            It's what you do to me<br>

            You know I got a soft spot for you<br>
            Baby, can't you see?<br>
            I need you, 'cause you're everything that I'm not<br>
            You know I got a soft spot for you<br>
            You know I got a soft spot for you<br><br>

            For you<br>
            For you<br>
            For you<br>
            You know I got a soft spot for you<br><br>
