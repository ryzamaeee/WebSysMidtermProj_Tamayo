            <p>Let me dive into your ocean of emotions<br>
            Let me crawl into your senses, love<br>
            Give you truth and my devotion, slow motion<br>
            Feel your body as I lay you down<br>
            'Cause I won't really mind<br>
            If you're gonna take all my clothes off, nee-nah-nah<br>
            To feel loved<br>
            Last piece of my life puzzle, you should know that I need ya<br>
            So, move your body close to mine<br>
            You've been talking to the last guy, uh<br>
            He's been asking you one last time<br>
            If he could try to mend and fix your broken heart, uh<br>
            Read back pages that you've torn apart<br>
            But all he gave you was destruction, desolation<br>
            He just believes in satisfaction, oh, oh<br>
            He cut your heart and left it open, now you're all in<br>
            And I don't want you as an option, girl, no<br><br>

            Let me dive into your ocean of emotions<br>
            Let me crawl into your senses, love<br>
            Give you truth and my devotion, slow motion<br>
            Feel your body as I lay you down<br>
            'Cause I won't really mind<br>

            Last piece of my life puzzle, you should know that I need ya<br>
            So, move your body close to mine<br><br>

            I was lying to myself lately<br>
            Denying the truth of how you just make me feel<br>
            I'm in here sitting, drinking whiskey at the corner<br>
            Waiting for you to come around and be my lover<br>
            Give me warmth, and I will let you ignite<br>
            We'll walk the streets on fire and fill it with lights<br>
            No, I don't want to be pretentious, you're a goddess<br>
            I sound a little bit ridiculous, but I'm honest<br><br>

            Let me dive into your ocean of emotions<br>
            Let me crawl into your senses, love<br>
            Give you truth and my devotion, slow motion<br>
            Feel your body as I lay you down<br>

            If you're gonna take all my clothes off, nee-nah-nah<br>

            Last piece of my life puzzle, you should know that, nee-nah-nah<br>
            So, move your body close to mine, oh, oh-oh<br>
            Nee-nah-nah (nee-nah-nah)<br>
            To feel loved<br>
            Nee-nah-nah (nee-nah-nah)<br>
            To feel loved<br>
            Nee-nah-nah (nee-nah-nah)<br>
            To feel loved<br>
