        <h1>About</h1>
        <br>
        <p align="justify"><b>"Soft Spot"</b> by <b>Keshi</b> is the song about falling's vulnerability. It personifies the experience of a historically guarded and resistant individual who suddenly finds himself completely captivated by someone new.<br><br>
            So on the opening lines of <i>"I don't go out but I'll do it for you,"</i> the writer lets the reader know of their willingness to break and get out of their system of routine for this someone. They are willing to do things they would rather not do, such as going out and dancing for that person.The repetition of <i>"Don't like anybody, tell me why it's different with you"</i> really plays off the confusion of the speaker and the special impact this person has on them. They admit to not believing in love, yet they can't deny the strong emotions that this person elicits in them. The chorus, repeated in the phrase <i>"You know I got a soft spot for you,"</i> illustrates the weak position of the speaker as well as the irresistible force they feel toward this person. It is a confession of weakness, a surrender to the power of love. This section, the song's bridge, reveals his inner turmoil. He has withstood the temptation for such a long time but can't imagine doing it without having this person in mind for later life. Even in this line, <i>"I just don't need somebody else to throw me aside,"</i> he has a perfectly valid fear of heartbreak but is still willing to take that risk for her. The song ends with a strong repetition of the chorus, which states that the speaker has finally surrendered himself to his feelings. It's a declaration of love, almost a confession that he cannot fight this undeniable connection to this person.<br><br>
            <b>"Soft Spot"</b> is so relatable and honest about falling in love, which sometimes happens against all expectations and the strife and happiness that come along with it. It really tells us that love can be an unexpected and very powerful thing, and even the most defended heart can be softened if that right person comes your way.</p>
